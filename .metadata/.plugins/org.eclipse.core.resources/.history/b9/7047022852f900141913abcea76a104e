/**
* @file xiicps_eeprom_polled_example.c
*
* This file consists of a polled mode design example which uses the Xilinx PS
* IIC device and XIicPs driver to exercise the EEPROM.
*
* The XIicPs_MasterSendPolled() API is used to transmit the data and
* XIicPs_MasterRecvPolled() API is used to receive the data.
*
* The example is tested with a 2Kb/8Kb serial IIC EEPROM (ST M24C02/M24C08).
* The WP pin of this EEPROM is hardwired to ground in the HW in which this
* was tested.
*
* The AddressType should be u8 as the address pointer in the on-board
* EEPROM is 1 bytes.
*
* This code assumes that no Operating System is being used.
*
* @note
*
* None.
*
* <pre>
* MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- ---------------------------------------------------------
* 1.00a sdm  03/15/10 First release
* 1.01a sg   04/13/12 Added MuxInit function for initializing the IIC Mux
*		      on the ZC702 board and to configure it for accessing
*		      the IIC EEPROM.
*                     Updated to use usleep instead of delay loop
* 1.04a hk   09/03/13 Removed GPIO code to pull MUX out of reset - CR#722425.
